# Word2Vec Word Similarity Project

## Overview
This project allows users to determine the similarity between two words from a user's input in a text file using Word2Vec in Python. Users can upload a text file, create a Word2Vec model based on the document's content, and then input two words to get their similarity score.

## Features
- **Word2Vec Model Creation**: Users can upload a `.txt` file to create a Word2Vec model based on the document's content.
- **Word Similarity**: Users can input two words from the uploaded document to get their similarity score using the trained Word2Vec model.
- **Streamlit Interface**: A simple and intuitive web interface for interacting with the Word2Vec model.

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/davoodoli/Word2Vec_Words_Similarity.git
